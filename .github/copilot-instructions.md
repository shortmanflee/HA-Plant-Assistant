The code in this repository is intended to be run within a python virtual environment to ensure that dependencies are managed correctly and do not interfere with other projects on your system.

When making a change to files in the repository, ensure that you run pre-commit hooks to maintain code quality and consistency. You can do this by executing the following command in your terminal:

```pre-commit run --all-files
```

NEVER run vscode tasks, run the commands directly in the terminal instead.
